# Welcome!

I am **Dr. Yanhong Peng (彭彦鸿)**, a tenure-track Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Chongqing University of Technology, China, and a Visiting Research Fellow at Nagoya University, Japan. My research focuses on **soft robotics**, **bio-inspired robotics**, **deep learning**, and **brain-computer interfaces**.

I hold a dual Bachelor's degree from Beijing Jiaotong University and the University of Wollongong (Australia), a Master's degree in Mechanical Systems Engineering, and a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering from **Nagoya University**, Japan. I had the privilege to be advised by several distinguished professors, including Prof. Yang Ju (Foreign Member of the Engineering Academy of Japan) and Prof. Yuki Funabora.
